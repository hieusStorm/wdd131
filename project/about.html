                <h2>What is Warframe?</h2>
                <p>Warframe is an online free to play third person shooter, with multiple game modes. These game modes
                    include exterminate(killing a certain amount of enenmies), defense(defending an object against
                    multiple waves of enenmies), spy(hacking into certain terminals without being noticed), and other
                    fun modes that build off these core modes. The customization of this game is vast and endless.</p>

                <h2>What is a build?</h2>
                <p>A build in Warframe refers to how a warframe set set up with gear and mods. Gear refers to the
                    weapons that are equiped. Mods refer things on that modify the statistics of the gear or warframe.

                <p>This site provides a place to view different builds from the community to see how you want to set up
                    your warframes. Feel free to use any of the builds that you want.</p>
                <p>Here is an example build:</p>
